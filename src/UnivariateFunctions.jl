# In terms of UnivariateFunction types we have the following seniority:
# Undefined_Function
# PE_Function
# Sum_Of_Functions
# Piecewise_Function

# In particular a Sum_Of_Functions contains the first two types of functions but never
# another Sum_Of_Functions (although one can be used to construct a Sum_Of_Functions). If a sum
# of functions contains an undefined function then it contains nothing else.
# A Piecewise_Function can have pieces composed of the first three categories but not another
# Piecewise_Function

# In terms of multiple dispatch rules this means that we:
# * define operators of each type of UnivariateFunction with another of its own type.
# * For each we define operators (f + x) with scalars. The reverse operations (x + f) can be done
#    all at once except for powers, subtraction and division where it matters.
#  All operations between these types should be defined for every pair. The seniority rule means that
#  Where a * b (where a and b are types) is the same as b * a then we define b*a = *(b,a) and put the
# relevent code in b * a place. Undefined_Function should take prevedence over PE_Function and etc
# in the seniority list.
